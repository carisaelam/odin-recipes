<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Steak (such as ribeye, sirloin, or filet mignon)</li>
  <li>Salt</li>
  <li>Black pepper</li>
  <li>Garlic powder</li>
  <li>Onion powder</li>
  <li>Butter (for basting)</li>
  <li>Fresh herbs (such as thyme or rosemary)</li>
  <li>Olive oil (for searing)</li>
  <li>Worcestershire sauce (optional)</li>
  <li>Balsamic vinegar (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Remove the steak from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature
    for 30-60 minutes to ensure even cooking.
  </li>
  <li>
    Season both sides of the steak generously with salt, black pepper, garlic
    powder, and onion powder.
  </li>
  <li>
    Preheat a skillet or grill over high heat. Brush the steak with olive oil to
    prevent sticking.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once the skillet or grill is hot, place the steak on it and sear for 2-3
    minutes on each side to achieve a golden crust.
  </li>
  <li>
    Lower the heat to medium and continue cooking the steak to the desired level
    of doneness, flipping it occasionally.
  </li>
  <li>
    Optional: Add a knob of butter and fresh herbs (such as thyme or rosemary)
    to the skillet or grill and baste the steak with the melted butter for extra
    flavor.
  </li>
  <li>
    Check the internal temperature of the steak using a meat thermometer. For
    rare, it should be around 120-125°F (49-52°C); for medium-rare, 130-135°F
    (54-57°C); for medium, 140-145°F (60-63°C); for medium-well, 150-155°F
    (66-68°C); for well-done, 160°F (71°C) and above.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once the steak reaches the desired doneness, remove it from the heat and let
    it rest for 5-10 minutes to allow the juices to redistribute.
  </li>
  <li>
    Optional: Drizzle the steak with Worcestershire sauce or balsamic vinegar
    for added flavor before serving.
  </li>
  <li>
    Slice the steak against the grain and serve hot, garnished with fresh herbs
    if desired. Enjoy!
