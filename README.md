## Recipes HTML project for TOP 

In this project, I put my HTML knowledge to the test by creating a simple recipe website. The site features a main index page with links to various recipes. I'm not worrying about making it look fancy just yet; the goal is to strengthen my HTML skills. Later on, I may revisit this project and enhance its appearance with CSS. For now, I'm focusing on building a solid HTML foundation.
